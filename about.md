Hi! I'm Shaurya Gupta, a sophomore at IIT Patna. I am a competitive programmer and will be participating in ACM-ICPC World Finals 2018. I love customising my Arch Linux setup and bragging about it. I'll be interning at D.E.Shaw Hyderabad in Summer 2018.

When not coding, I'm usually either watching korean television shows or reading One Piece, Webtoons or novels.

You can contact me on my [email](mailto:shauryab98@outlook.com) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shauryab98).
