Hi! I'm **Shaurya Gupta**, a Junior at IIT Patna. I enjoy competitive programmer and participated in the **ACM-ICPC World Finals 2018**. I interned at **D.E.Shaw Hyderabad** in Summer 2018. I love ricing my Arch Linux setup and bragging about it. 

When not coding, I'm usually either watching korean television shows or reading One Piece, Webtoons or novels.

You can contact me on my [Email](mailto:shauryab98@outlook.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SureYeaah) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SureYeaah).
